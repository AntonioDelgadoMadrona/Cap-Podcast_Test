DEFINITION

For the realization of this project I have done it under a structural and creational design, always trying to encapsulate the code with a defined purpose. I have used to assemble the project with Vite, React, Context-API, TypeScript, Vitest/Jest, React Testing Library...

I decided to use vite, for its speed and lightness. It is one of the options recommended by the React official documentation.
